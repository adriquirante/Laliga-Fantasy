# Laliga-Fantasy
Laliga Fantasy is a well-known mobile game where you create your own team with real players and receive points depending on how good your players perform in real life. The aim of this project was creating an algorithm to predict the best possible team based on the previous year data.

We approached this problem in three different ways. First we did an exhaustive search algorithm, then a greedy one and, at last, a metaheuristic algorithm. The code of these algorithms are in exh, gr and mh files respectively.
